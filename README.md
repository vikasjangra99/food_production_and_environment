Impacts of food production and environment

Problem:  
Environmental and socio-economic repercussions are becoming more linked to food supply networks. The overall sustainability of food production and consumption faces severe issues as the world population grows, consumer needs evolve, and consumption models change.
The demand for water, food, and energy has tremendously increased with the rise in the world population. Almost 50% of the habitable land on planet Earth has been used for agriculture. U.S. agriculture emitted an estimated 698 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide equivalent in 2018 and has been rising since. This has led to climate change and is having a direct impact on global temperatures. The annual average temperature over the contiguous United States has increased by 1.2째F (0.7째C) over the last few decades and by 1.8째F (1.0째C) relative to the beginning of the last century. 

Methodology: 
1. Descriptive analytics, aiming to explore the relationship between types of food and the carbon-dioxide emissions they generate. 
2. Prescriptive analytics, considering restrictions like adult's calories intake per day, resources capacity, and carbon dioxide emissions to find a suitable and sustainable daily food combination. 

Hypothesis:  
1.	Do carbon emissions from food production affect the environment?
2.	Does the water consumption used when producing food affect the food calories?
3.	Does the water consumption affect the carbon emission?

The implication of the project is to have sustainable farming with minimum effect on the environment and have a balanced human diet.
